<b> Trigger: </b>The user scrolls vertically.
</p>
<p>
<b> Rules:</b> When the user scrolls down from the top of the page, the main elements of the page scroll over the hero image, which remains fixed. 
<br>
When the user has scrolled past the hero image being visible, the search bar and sidebar remain fixed at their location at that point. 
<br>
The recipe section continues to scroll up and is covered by the search bar.
<br>
When the user scrolls back up to the top of the page, the search bar, sidebar, and hero return to their initial location.
</p>
<p>
<b>Feedback:</b> The hero remains fixed while the content beneath moves up to cover it. The search bar and side bar remain fixed when the search bar is at the top of the page.

<b> Loops: </b> N/A
